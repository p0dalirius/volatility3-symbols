Despite hours of work, all of these **637** symbols are generated and shared for free. So if you find this project useful, please ‚≠ê this repo or support my work on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/podalirius).

If you're using volatility 2, you should check out [volatility2-profiles](https://github.com/p0dalirius/volatility2-profiles).

## Installation

Each of these symbols is packaged as a compressed `.json.xz` file. You can enable them individually in your Volatility installation by copying:

 - Linux symbols in `volatility3/symbols/linux/`
 - Mac symbols in `volatility3/symbols/mac/`
 - Windows symbols in `volatility3/symbols/windows/`

:warning: Only enable the symbols you plan to use. If you copy all symbol files into the aforementioned directories, Volatility will be extremely slow to load.

## Issues
